CardioXplainAI is a hybrid deep learning framework developed for accurate and interpretable ECG-based cardiac abnormality recognition. It integrates a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and a Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU) with an adaptive attention fusion mechanism to capture both morphological waveform patterns and sequential temporal dependencies. The system supports explainability through attention visualizations and Grad-CAM overlays, helping clinicians understand the modelâ€™s decisions. Designed for robust performance across patient records, CardioXplainAI achieves high F1-scores and ROC-AUC while maintaining clinical transparency. This project supports reproducible research and is currently under review in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering (TBME).
