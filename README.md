# ECGAbnormalityDetectionDL
A deep learning-based system for robust and accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from ECG signals


# CardioXplainAI

**CardioXplainAI** is an interpretable deep learning framework proposed for automated detection of cardiac abnormalities from ECG signals. This work is associated with the paper:

> **CardioXplainAI: An Interpretable Hybrid TCN-GRU Deep Learning Framework with Adaptive Attention for ECG-Based Cardiac Abnormality Recognition**  
> *Sairam Vallabhuni, Dr. P.V.Naganjaneyulu and Dr. N.Renuka*  
> *Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering (TBME), under review*

## üî¨ Overview

CardioXplainAI integrates a **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** and **Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU)** with an **adaptive attention fusion** layer. This hybrid approach captures both fine-grained waveform morphology and sequential rhythm patterns in ECG signals. To ensure clinical trust and transparency, the model incorporates **explainability** using both attention weights and Grad-CAM visualizations.

## üöÄ Features
- ECG signal segmentation, denoising, and normalization
- Hybrid model: TCN for multi-scale temporal patterns + Bi-GRU for sequential dynamics
- Adaptive attention mechanism for feature fusion
- Cross-validated training strategy with early stopping
- Explainability using attention overlays and Grad-CAM
- Performance evaluation using F1-score, accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrix
